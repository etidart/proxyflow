proxyflow - the proxy relay
===========================
this program periodically checks proxies, measures their response times, and redirects user requests to the best proxies

list of issues that need to be fixed:
- an incorrect user request will cause the proxy to fail, resulting in the deletion of the proxy due to exceeding the error limit
- timeouts are hardcoded and are not even in the const section
- issues with network connection will result in the deletion of the proxy due to exceeding the error limit
- functionality for adding proxies to storage while the program is running has not yet been implemented
- error descriptions received from the connector are ignored
- the map of bad proxies is not utilized, but it can be used to return proxies to the normal map or to save them elsewhere
